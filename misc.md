## Reasonable  results for trading strategies
In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywLgtcUefB8) video Eric Crown goes through some (in his view) good results for trading strategies. Calculating the average profitability as `average win * win rate - average loss * (1 - win rate)` for these examples for different intervals gives the following results:

| Interval  | Average profitability | 
|-----------|-----------------------|
| 5 minute  | 0.0063                |
| 15 minute | 0.0039                |
| 30 minute | 0.0070                |
| 1 hour    | 0.0091                |
| 4 hour    | 0.0202                |
| 1 day     | 0.0585                |

These values are by no means law, but they do give an approximation of the level that a well performing strategy should be at.
