## Todos
- [ ] Change way of calculating BBWP so it doesn't populate candles with BBW values. Also consider whether all Bollinger Band related indicators should really contain instances of  "lower" indicators (should BBW hold an instance of BB?)
- [ ] Add live tracking, so that when a new candle is formed for a particular time frame, the indicators/strategies are updated.
- [ ] Add Silver cross strategy. 21 ema crosses 55 ema. Description [here](https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/286844)
- [ ] Add DMI indicator. Description [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dmi.asp)
