- [ ] Missing candles in the websocket implementation is causing indicators to populate incorrectly. We need to look into the add_candle method in timeseries and setup some connection to the historical data implementation such that when the added candle is not the logical next step we fetch historical data and patch any potential holes in the series.
- [ ] From [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OinAn0dY33E) video at around 5:55 Krown says that the 96% PMAR(P) value might be a good target for taking profit. Investigate this and maybe implement as a resolutionstrategy.
- [ ] Check the add_candle method inside the TimeSeries class
- [ ] Checkout the shuttle crate for deploying the app
- [ ] Build indicator from the basic idea of spotting reversions by identifying large moves. So if for example the average candle move over the last 100 candles is 1% and suddenly we see a 5% move, chances are that something significant is happening. Build an indicator that registers the percentile of the width of the candle. One example of a strategy built on this could be that in general after a (or a couple) huge candle there will probably be some correction, maybe this indicator could catch that.
