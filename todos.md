- [ ] From [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OinAn0dY33E) video at around 5:55 Krown says that the 96% PMAR(P) value might be a good target for taking profit. Investigate this and maybe implement as a resolutionstrategy.
- [ ] Checkout the shuttle crate for deploying the app
- [ ] Build indicator from the basic idea of spotting reversions by identifying large moves. So if for example the average candle move over the last 100 candles is 1% and suddenly we see a 5% move, chances are that something significant is happening. Build an indicator that registers the percentile of the width of the candle. One example of a strategy built on this could be that in general after a (or a couple) huge candle there will probably be some correction, maybe this indicator could catch that.
- [ ] Something is wrong when running the single indicator run. Candles get added too much so thatt the currently added candle gets added to the ts before it is closed. Maybe related to candle popping in payload from bybit or similar. Investigate and write some sort of test so this can be discovered at an earlier time next time.
- [ ] Keep building the stochastic oscillator. Indicator now works as intended, only needs to write tests to ensure stability. Investigate why all of the indicators seem to get 1.0 as value.
